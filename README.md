## Description

You are working with SAP BTP and looking for the metadata of the services in a *machine-readable* format? Then you are at the right place: this repository contains the metadata of the SAP BTP services available via a SAP BTP *pay-as-you-go* account.

As different personas need different metadata when exploring the service metadata we decided to curate it for you. As criterion we use a *persona*+*-based approach as we are convinced that this will give the optimal support for the task at hand.

We start with the persona *"developer"*. Based on the requirements of this persona we collected the metadata per service in the folder `v0/developer` as JSON files. In addition, we provide a inventory list as an overview of all available services to enable to have a quick overview what is available and what is not.

Based on your feedback we will add additional personas and additional curated metadata.

## Feedback

You may ask: what is your intention? The answer is that we would love to hear you feedback on:

- the data itself (is there something missing etc.).
- the ways how you would like to see the data provisioned for you. We are aware that plain JSON can only be a first step.

You do not know where to start? Need some inspiration? Then this [section](./metadata-exploration/README.md) could be of interest to you.

## Are you using the metadata?

Of course we leverage the information ourselves in the [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator/) to generate the JSON schemas for the input files used in this open-source tool. Take a look at the repository to get some inspiration on how to leverage the data for your scenarios.
